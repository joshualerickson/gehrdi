The goal of gwavr (Gee-waver) is to Get Water Attributes Visually in R (gwavr). This allows the user to point and click on areas within the United States and get back hydrological data, e.g. flowlines, catchments, basin boundaries, comids, etc. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the  [{nhdplusTools}](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/nhdplusTools) (much thanks) as well as the [{leaflet}](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet) extensions and all this package does is wrap them into a app. Enjoy!  

## Installation

You can install `gwavr` from CRAN:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages('gwavr')
```

To install the development version of the `gwavr` package, you can
install directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joshualerickson/gwavr")
```

## Contributions  

Contributions are welcome!  

## Current Functionality  

There are a handful of functions right now that can help with getting water data visually: `get_nhdplus_interactively()`, `get_nldi_interactively()`, `get_basin_interactively()`, `get_streamnetwork_interactively()`, `get_usgs_iv_interactively()`, `get_usgs_dv_interactively()`, `get_noaatlas_interactively()`. Please read the manual for more information on how to use these functions.  

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: getting water data without knowing the exact lat, lon via a shiny application.

```{r example, eval=F}
library(gwavr)
## basic example code

nhdplus_data <- get_nhdplus_interactively()

## or for NLDI

nldi_data <- get_nldi_interactively()
```
